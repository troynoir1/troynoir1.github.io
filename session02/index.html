 <p class ="thisparagraph"><span class="subhead">I’m a huge fan of this product!</span><br> 
 I have been trying and chucking hand creams for years and this is the first one that has found a lasting place in my handbag. I struggle with very dry hands that feel like they are burning due to the caustic chemicals I work with. This balm relieves the cracks, burning, and dryness that plagues me and leaves baby soft hands that aren’t greasy or slippery. Plus it smells divine!</p>

		<p class ="thisparagraph">The seller is not selling accurate size that is in description!<br>
		 The 3.4oz is $33 on Aesop website and this seller is claiming 4.8oz for the $55 price! You will receive a 3.4oz tube instead! Very predatory and misleading to mislabel the amount a buyer is paying for! Product is excellent, but I will NEVER buy from this seller!</p>

		<p class ="thisparagraph"> Based on the reviews I was expecting a heavenly orange scent.<br/> 
		This is just 'meh' and not impressive at all! Very faint scent that doesn't last on the skin. I don't understand all the positive reviews. You can get much better smelling orange lotions elsewhere. The lotion doesn't even moisturize very well. I will never repurchase this brand again. Shipped quickly though.</p>

		<p class ="thisparagraph">We ordered this to replace the 120ml tube that my wife had used up,<br/> however on opening we found it was only 100ml not 120ml as advertised. We contacted the seller to ask for a proportionate refund but heard nothing so we returned it and I visited an Aesop branch in London and bought a replacement at a substantial saving.</p>

   <p class ="thisparagraph">I wash my hands and use sanitizer all day at work and this cream is the what I use before and after work and it saves my hands! ><br/>
   The light citrus scent isn’t overpowering and smells natural. Planning on ordering another tube after this is out!</p>
